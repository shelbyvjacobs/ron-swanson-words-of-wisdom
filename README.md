Under Construction.

### Description
This app pulls from the Ron Swanson Quotes API to display quotes straight from the man himself in a carousel UI pattern.

### Goals
I had a few goals for this project:
* Utilize React to create a simple app.
* Connect to an API to display information.
* Create a carousel for users to click through to read the quotes.

### Example
Screenshots coming soon.

### Features
This is a single page app the was created to display five random quotes from Ron Swanson in a carousel UI pattern.

### Technologies Used
This game was created with React and SCSS. All of the quotes are fetched fromt the Ron Swanson Quotes API created by jamesseanwright on GitHub, available [here](https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes).

### Getting Started
